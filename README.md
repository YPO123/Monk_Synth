# Monk Synth

## Project Overview

Monk Synth is a web-based audio synthesizer built with p5.js, inspired by an interest in Buddhism and the exploration of sound synthesis. This project aims to provide an interactive audio synthesis environment where users can control sound waveforms and pitch through various inputs.

## Features

- **Dual Oscillators**: Each oscillator can select different waveforms and adjust ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) parameters.
- **Audio Visualization**: Visual representation of audio waveforms in real-time, allowing users to see the sound changes visually.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can adjust audio parameters using sliders and buttons to create diverse sound effects.

## Live Demo

Experience Monk Synth live through this link: [Monk Synth Live](https://editor.p5js.org/1805318611/full/ivbzDqVz1)

## Local Installation

To run Monk Synth locally, you need to clone the repository first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YPO123/Monk_Synth.git
```

Then, you can serve the project using any static server. For instance, if you have Node.js installed, you can use http-server:

```bash
  npm install -g http-server
  cd Monk_Synth
  http-server
```

Access http://localhost:8080 to start the synthesizer.

## Usage

Once the project is up and running, the interface will provide several control options:

- **Waveform Selection**: Click on the waveform buttons to choose the desired oscillator waveform.
- **ADSR Control**: Use the ADSR sliders to adjust the dynamics of the sound.
- **Frequency Adjustment**: Drag the frequency sliders to change the base frequency of the oscillator.
